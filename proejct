🧠 Game Idea (Simple)

Word Duel is a 2-player turn-based word game where both players use the same set of letters to form words and score points. The goal is to outscore your opponent within a fixed number of rounds.

👥 Players

Exactly 2 players

Both see the same letters

Both get equal turns

🔤 Game Setup

At the start of the game, a random set of letters is generated
Example:

Letters: A, T, R, E, S, N


Total rounds: e.g. 5 rounds

Time per turn: e.g. 30 seconds

🔁 How a Round Works
Step 1: Player A’s Turn

Player A uses the given letters to make one word

The word must:

Use only the given letters

Not reuse letters more times than available

Be at least 3 letters long

Player submits the word before time runs out

Example:

Player A: "EARN"

Step 2: Player B’s Turn

Player B uses the same letters

Same rules apply

Example:

Player B: "STAR"

🧮 Scoring Rules

Score = length of the word

Examples:

CAT → 3 points

EARN → 4 points

STREAM → 6 points

If a player:

Submits an invalid word → 0 points

Runs out of time → 0 points

🔄 Rounds Continue

A → EARN (4 pts)
B → STAR (4 pts)

Round 2:
A → TEN (3 pts)
B → timeout (0 pts)
